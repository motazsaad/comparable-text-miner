This is Arabic and English emotion lexicon during the PhD work of [Saad, 2015]. This lexicon is an extension of WordNet-Affect (WNA) emotion lexicon [Strapparava and Mihalcea, 2007], which is a subset of English WordNet. Each entry (synset) in this lexicon is annotated with one of six emotions (anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, and surprise), which are considered as the basic human emotions according to the psychological study conducted in [Ekman, 1992]. 

we manually translated it into Arabic. The Table below describes the English and the Arabic lexicons, where syn is the number of synsets (synonym words are grouped into sets and called synsets), and w is the number of words associated with each emotion label. 



| Emotion  | syn | English w | Arabic w |
|----------|------:|------------:|-----------:|
| anger    |   127 |         351 |        748 |
| disgust  |    19 |          83 |        155 |
| fear     |    82 |         221 |        425 |
| joy      |   227 |         543 |       1156 |
| sadness  |   123 |         259 |        522 |
| surprise |    28 |          94 |        201 |
| Total    |   606 |        1551 |       3207 |
